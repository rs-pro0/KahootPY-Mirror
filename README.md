KahootPY Mirror
This is isn't an official KahootPY, because it was taked down I created this repo to upload it here.
I downloaded it using pip (because it is still on pypi) and uploaded here.
So enjoy programming bots for kahoot.

# Requirements & Installing
You need [Python](https://python.org)
Official install:
`pip install kahootpy`
You also can install it from this repo.
In future maybe this repo will be on pypi but now it isn't.

# Documentation
Sorry, but i didn't found docs, so I'll be happy if you help me with it.
